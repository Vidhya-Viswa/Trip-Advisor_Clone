In this project, I focused on building a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout inspired by TripAdvisorâ€™s travel platform. The goal was to understand how large travel websites structure their content and design elements to provide a smooth experience for users exploring destinations, hotels, and restaurants.

ðŸ§  What I Learned:
Structuring web pages effectively using HTML semantic tags
Designing responsive layouts with CSS Flexbox and Grid
Understanding how to recreate professional website layouts from scratch
